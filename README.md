# Artificial-Data-Generation-and-Training-using-GANs

In this code, MNIST Fashion Dataset is used to create artificial dataset.
Combination of 50% actual data and 50% artificial (GAN generated) data are combined and the new dataset is trained using CNN.
The various artificially generated data plots after various epochs are also attached.

Note: MNIST Fashion Dataset is publicly available and can be converted to .csv format to run this code.
